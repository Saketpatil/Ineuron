# Social Media Community Using Optimized Clustering Algorithm

## Overview

This project is aimed at developing a social media community platform that utilizes an optimized clustering algorithm to enhance user experience and engagement. The platform leverages various Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc., for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Additionally, MySQL is used as the underlying database management system to store and manage user data efficiently.

## Features

- **Optimized Clustering Algorithm:** Utilizes an efficient clustering algorithm to group users based on common interests, behaviors, or demographics, enhancing community engagement and interaction.

- **Python Libraries:** Utilizes popular Python libraries including NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for efficient data handling, analysis, and visualization.

- **SQL Database (MySQL):** Employs MySQL as the backend database to store user data, posts, comments, and other relevant information, ensuring data integrity and scalability.

- **High-Level Design (HLD):** Provides a comprehensive overview of the system architecture, components, and interactions at a high level.

- **Low-Level Design (LLD):** Offers detailed design specifications and implementation plans for individual system components, modules, and functionalities.

- **Wireframe:** Presents visual representations of the user interface design, outlining the layout, navigation, and interaction elements of the social media community platform.

- **Architecture Documentation:** Provides detailed documentation describing the system architecture, including components, modules, interfaces, and their interactions.

## Installation
